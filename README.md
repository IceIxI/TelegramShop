It's a telegram bot for selling various products. If you want, it can be easily adapted to your own company. 

All data is stored in a SQLite database. For viewing and editing I recommend using SQLite Studio: https://sqlitestudio.pl.

Also in the bot there is an administrator panel for adding and deleting products. It is launched using the command "/edit". Requires improvement. 

To start the bot you need to install all libraries and in the .env file enter the token and your ID in Telegram (it can be easily found out through the special bot).

Good luck using it!
